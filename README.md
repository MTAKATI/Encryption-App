# Encryption App

This Python-based application provides encryption and decryption functionality for text messages. It utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface and base64 encoding for secure data transformation. Users can input their message and a secret key for encryption, and the app will generate the encrypted output. Decryption is also supported with the correct key. The app offers simplicity, security, and ease of use.
